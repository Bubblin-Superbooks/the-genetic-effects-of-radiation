<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>44</p><p>As long as man-made radiation exists, there will be some absorption of it by human beings. The advantages of its use in our modern society are such that we must be prepared to pay some price. This is not a matter of callousness. We have come to depend a great deal for comfort and even for extended life, upon the achievements of our technology, and any serious crippling of that technology will cost us lives. An attempt must be made to balance the values of radiation against its dangers; we must balance lives against lives. This involves hard judgments.</p><p>Those working under conditions of greatest radiation risk&mdash;in atomic research, in industrial plants using isotopes, and so on&mdash;can be allowed to set relatively high limits for total radiation dosages and dose rates that they may absorb (with time) with reasonable safety, but such rates will never do for the population generally.</p></div> </div>
