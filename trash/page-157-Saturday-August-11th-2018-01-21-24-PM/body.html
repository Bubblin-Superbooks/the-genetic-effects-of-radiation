Any pretense of that sort may well lure us into assuming still greater damage&mdash;damage we may not be able to afford under any circumstances and for any reason.</p><p>Actually, as the situation appears right now, it is not likely that the use of radiation in modern medicine, research, and industry will overstep the maximum bounds set by scientists who have weighed the problem carefully. Only nuclear warfare is likely to do so, and apparently those governments with large capacities in this direction are thoroughly aware of the danger and (so far, at least) have guided their foreign policies accordingly.</p></div> </div>
