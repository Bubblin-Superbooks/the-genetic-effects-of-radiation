The genetic load might increase to the point where the species as a whole would degenerate and fade toward extinction&mdash;a sort of &ldquo;racial radiation sickness&rdquo;.</p><p>We are not near this threshold now, however, and can, therefore, as a species, absorb a moderate increase in mutation rate without danger of extinction.</p><p>On the other hand, it is not correct to argue, as some do, that an increase in mutation rate might be actually beneficial. The argument runs that a higher mutation rate might broaden the gene pool and make it more flexible, thus speeding up the course of evolution and hastening the advent of &ldquo;supermen&rdquo;&mdash;brainier, stronger, healthier than we ourselves are.</p></div> </div>
