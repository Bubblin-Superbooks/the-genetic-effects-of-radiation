<h1 title="">The Genetic Effects of Radiation</h1>
<h2 id="c1">THE MACHINERY OF INHERITANCE</h2>
<h3 id="c2">Introduction</h3>
<p>There is nothing new under the sun, says the Bible. Nor
is the sun itself new, we might add. As long as life has
existed on earth, it has been exposed to radiation from the
sun, so that life and radiation are old acquaintances and
have learned to live together.</p>
<p>We are accustomed to looking upon sunlight as something
good, useful, and desirable, and certainly we could not
live long without it. The energy of sunlight warms the
earth, produces the winds that tend to equalize earth&rsquo;s
temperatures, evaporates the oceans and produces rain
and fresh water. Most important of all, it supplies what is
needed for green plants to convert carbon dioxide and
water into food and oxygen, making it possible for all
animal life (including ourselves) to live.</p>
<p>Yet sunlight has its dangers, too. Lizards avoid the
direct rays of the noonday sun on the desert, and we ourselves
take precautions against sunburn and sunstroke.</p>
<p>The same division into good and bad is to be found in
connection with other forms of radiation&mdash;forms of which
mankind has only recently become aware. Such radiations,
produced by radioactivity in the soil and reaching us from
outer space, have also been with us from the beginning of
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
time. They are more energetic than sunlight, however, and
can do more damage, and because our senses do not detect
them, we have not learned to take precautions against
them.</p>
<p>To be sure, energetic radiation is present in nature in
only very small amounts and is not, therefore, much of a
danger. Man, however, has the capacity of imitating nature.
Long ago in dim prehistory, for instance, he learned to
manufacture a kind of sunlight by setting wood and other
fuels on fire. This involved a new kind of good and bad.
A whole new technology became possible, on the one hand,
and, on the other, the chance of death by burning was also
possible. The good in this case far outweighs the evil.</p>
<p>In our own twentieth century, mankind learned to produce
energetic radiation in concentrations far surpassing those
we usually encounter in nature. Again, a new technology is
resulting and again there is the possibility of death.</p>
<p>The balance in this second instance is less certainly in
favor of the good over the evil. To shift the balance clearly
in favor of the good, it is necessary for mankind to learn
as much as possible about the new dangers in order that
we might minimize them and most effectively guard against
them.</p>
<p>To see the nature of the danger, let us begin by considering
living tissue itself&mdash;the living tissue that must withstand
the radiation and that can be damaged by it.</p>
<h3 id="c3">Cells and Chromosomes</h3>
<p>The average human adult consists of about 50 trillion
<i>cells</i>&mdash;50 trillion microscopic, more or less self-contained,
blobs of life. He begins life, however, as a single
cell, the <i>fertilized ovum</i>.</p>
<p>After the fertilized ovum is formed, it divides and
becomes two cells. Each daughter cell divides to produce
a total of four cells, and each of those divides and so on.</p>
<p>There is a high degree of order and direction to those
divisions. When a human fertilized ovum completes its
divisions an adult human being is the inevitable result.
The fertilized ovum of a giraffe will produce a giraffe,
that of a fruit fly will produce a fruit fly, and so on. There
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
are no mistakes, so it is quite clear that the fertilized
ovum must carry &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; that guide its development
in the appropriate direction.</p>
<p>These &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; are contained in the cell&rsquo;s <i>chromosomes</i>,
tiny structures that appear most clearly (like
stubby bits of tangled spaghetti) when the cell is in the
actual process of division. Each species has some characteristic
number of chromosomes in its cells, and these
chromosomes can be considered in pairs. Human cells,
for instance, contain 23 pairs of chromosomes&mdash;46 in all.</p>
<p>When a cell is undergoing division (<i>mitosis</i>), the number
of chromosomes is temporarily doubled, as each chromosome
brings about the formation of a replica of itself.
(This process is called <i>replication</i>.) As the cell divides,
the chromosomes are evenly shared by the new cells in
such a way that if a particular chromosome goes into one
daughter cell, its replica goes into the other. In the end,
each cell has a complete set of pairs of chromosomes;
and the set in each cell is identical with the set in the
original cell before division.</p>

<a href="#pic_4">mitosis diagram</a> on preceding page). This brings a result like the

<p>In this way, the fundamental &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; that determine
the characteristics of a cell are passed on to each
new cell. Ideally, all the trillions of cells in a particular
human being have identical sets of &ldquo;instructions&rdquo;.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<h3 id="c4">Enzymes and Genes</h3>
<p>Each cell is a tiny chemical factory in which several
thousand different kinds of chemical changes are constantly
taking place among the numerous sorts of molecules that
move about in its fluid or that are pinned to its solid structures.
These chemical changes are guided and controlled
by the existence of as many thousands of different <i>enzymes</i>
within the cell.</p>
<p>Enzymes possess large molecules built up of some 20
different, but chemically related, units called <i>amino acids</i>.
A particular enzyme molecule may contain a single amino
acid of one type, five of another, several dozen of still
another and so on. All the units are strung together in
some specific pattern in one long chain, or in a small
number of closely connected chains.</p>
<p>Every different pattern of amino acids forms a molecule
with its own set of properties, and there are an enormous
number of patterns possible. In an enzyme molecule made
up of 500 amino acids, the number of possible patterns
can be expressed by a 1 followed by 1100 zeroes (10&sup1;&sup1;&#8304;&#8304;).</p>
<p>Every cell has the capacity of choosing among this
unimaginable number of possible patterns and selecting
those characteristic of itself. It therefore ends with a
complement of specific enzymes that guide its own chemical
changes and, consequently, its properties and its
behavior. The &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; that enable a fertilized ovum
to develop in the proper manner are essentially &ldquo;instructions&rdquo;
for choosing a particular set of enzyme patterns
out of all those possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>The differences in the enzyme-guided behavior of the
cells making up different species show themselves in differences
in body structure. We cannot completely follow
the long and intricate chain of cause-and-effect that leads
from one set of enzymes to the long neck of a giraffe and
from another set of enzymes to the large brain of a man,
but we are sure that the chain is there. Even within a
species, different individuals will have slight distinctions
among their sets of enzymes and this accounts for the fact
that no two human beings are exactly alike (leaving identical
twins out of consideration).</p>
<p>Each chromosome can be considered as being composed
of small sections called <i>genes</i>, usually pictured as being
strung along the length of the chromosome. Each gene is
considered to be responsible for the formation of a chain
of amino acids in a fixed pattern. The formation is guided
by the details of the gene&rsquo;s own structure (which are the
&ldquo;instructions&rdquo; earlier referred to). This gene structure,
which can be translated into an enzyme&rsquo;s structure, is
now called the <i>genetic code</i>.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_8">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="568" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Stained section of one cell from salivary gland of</i> Drosophila, <i>or
fruit flies, reveals dark bands that may be genes controlling specific
traits</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>If a particular enzyme (or group of enzymes) is, for any
reason, formed imperfectly or not at all, this may show up
as some visible abnormality of the body&mdash;an inability to
see color, for instance, or the possession of two joints in
each finger rather than three. It is much easier to observe
physical differences than some delicate change in the
enzyme pattern of the cells. Genes are therefore usually
referred to by the body change they bring about, and one
can, for instance, speak of a &ldquo;gene for color blindness&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A gene may exist in two or more varieties, each producing
a slightly different enzyme, a situation that is reflected,
in turn, in slight changes in body characteristics.
Thus, there are genes governing eye color, one of which is
sufficiently important to be considered a &ldquo;gene for blue
eyes&rdquo; and another a &ldquo;gene for brown eyes&rdquo;. One or the
other, but not both, will be found in a specific place on a
specific chromosome.</p>
<p>The two chromosomes of a particular pair govern
identical sets of characteristics. Both, for instance, will
have a place for genes governing eye color. If we consider
only the most important of the varieties involved,
those on each chromosome of the pair may be identical;
both may be for blue eyes or both may be for brown eyes.
In that case, the individual is <i>homozygous</i> for that characteristic
and may be referred to as a <i>homozygote</i>. The
chromosomes of the pair may carry different varieties:
A gene for blue eyes on one chromosome and one for
brown eyes on the other. The individual is then <i>heterozygous</i>
for that characteristic and may be referred to as a
<i>heterozygote</i>. Naturally, particular individuals may be
homozygous for some types of characteristics and heterozygous
for others.</p>
<p>When an individual is heterozygous for a particular
characteristic, it frequently happens that he shows the
effect associated with only one of the gene varieties. If
he possesses both a gene for brown eyes and one for blue
eyes, his eyes are just as brown as though he had carried
two genes for brown eyes. The gene for brown eyes is
<i>dominant</i> in this case while the gene for blue eyes is
<i>recessive</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<h3 id="c5">Parents and Offspring</h3>
<p>How does the fertilized ovum obtain its particular set of
chromosomes in the first place?</p>
<p>Each adult possesses gonads in which <i>sex cells</i> are
formed. In the male, sperm cells are formed in the testes;
in the female, egg cells are formed in the ovaries.</p>
<p>In the formation of the sperm cells and egg cells there
is a key step&mdash;<i>meiosis</i>&mdash;a cell division in which the
chromosomes group into pairs and are then apportioned
between the daughter cells, one of each pair to each cell.
Such a division, unaccompanied by replication, means that
in place of the usual 23 pairs of chromosomes in each other
cell, each sex cell has 23 individual chromosomes, a
&ldquo;half-set&rdquo;, so to speak.</p>
<p>In the process of fertilization, a sperm cell from the
father enters and merges with an egg cell from the mother.
The fertilized ovum that results now has a full set of 23
pairs of chromosomes, but of each pair, one comes from
the father and one from the mother.</p>
<p>In this way, each newborn child is a true individual, with
its characteristics based on a random reshuffling of
chromosomes. In forming the sex cells, the chromosome
pairs can separate in either fashion (<i>a</i> into cell 1 and <i>b</i>
into cell 2, or vice versa). If each of 23 pairs does this
randomly, nearly 10 million different combinations of
chromosomes are possible in the sex cells of a single
individual.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one can&rsquo;t predict which chromosome combination
in the sperm cell will end up in combination with
which in the egg cell, so that by this reasoning, a single
married couple could produce children with any of 100 trillion
(100,000,000,000,000) possible chromosome combinations.</p>
<p>It is this that begins to explain the endless variety among
living beings, even within a particular species.</p>
<p>It only begins to explain it, because there are other
sources of difference, too. A chromosome is capable of
exchanging pieces with its pair, producing chromosomes
with a brand new pattern of gene varieties. Before such a
<i>crossover</i>, one chromosome may have carried a gene for
blue eyes and one for wavy hair, while the other chromosome
may have carried a gene for brown eyes and one for
straight hair. After the crossover, one would carry genes
for blue eyes and straight hair, the other for brown eyes
and wavy hair.</p>

<h2 id="c6">MUTATIONS</h2>
<h3 id="c7">Sudden Change</h3>
<p>Shifts in chromosome combinations, with or without
crossovers, can produce unique organisms with characteristics
not quite like any organism that appeared in the past
nor likely to appear in the reasonable future. They may
even produce novelties in individual characteristics since
genes can affect one another, and a gene surrounded by
unusual neighbors can produce unexpected effects.</p>
<p>Matters can go further still, however, in the direction of
novelty. It is possible for chromosomes to undergo more
serious changes, either structural or chemical, so that
entirely new characteristics are produced that might not
otherwise exist. Such changes are called <i>mutations</i>.</p>
<p>We must be careful how we use this term. A child may
possess some characteristics not present in either parent
through the mere shuffling of chromosomes and not through
mutation.</p>
<p>Suppose, for instance, that a man is heterozygous to eye
color, carrying one gene for brown eyes and one for blue
eyes. His eyes would, of course, be brown since the gene
for brown eyes is dominant over that for blue. Half the
sperm cells he produces would carry a single gene for
brown eyes in its half set of chromosomes. The other half
would carry a single gene for blue eyes. If his wife were
similarly heterozygous (and therefore also had brown eyes),
half her egg cells would carry the gene for brown eyes and
half the gene for blue.</p>
<p>It might follow in this marriage, then, that a sperm
carrying the gene for blue eyes might fertilize an egg
carrying the gene for blue eyes. The child would then be
homozygous, with two genes for blue eyes, and he would
definitely be blue-eyed. In this way, two brown-eyed parents
might have a blue-eyed child and this would <i>not</i> be a
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
mutation. If the parents&rsquo; ancestry were traced further back,
blue-eyed individuals would undoubtedly be found on both
sides of the family tree.</p>
<p>If, however, there were no record of, say, anything but
normal color vision in a child&rsquo;s ancestry, and he were born
color-blind, that could be assumed to be the result of a
mutation. Such a mutation could then be passed on by the
normal modes of inheritance and a certain proportion of
the child&rsquo;s eventual descendants would be color-blind.</p>
<p>A mutation may be associated with changes in chromosome
structure sufficiently drastic to be visible under the
microscope. Such <i>chromosome mutations</i> can arise in
several ways. Chromosomes may undergo replication without
the cell itself dividing. In that way, cells can develop
with two, three, or four times the normal complement of
chromosomes, and organisms made up of cells displaying
such <i>polyploidy</i> can be markedly different from the norm.
This situation is found chiefly among plants and among
some groups of invertebrates. It does not usually occur in
mammals, and when it does it leads to quick death.</p>
<p>Less extreme changes take place, too, as when a particular
chromosome breaks and fails to reunite, or when several
break and then reunite incorrectly. Under such conditions,
the mechanism by which chromosomes are distributed
among the daughter cells is not likely to work correctly.
Sex cells may then be produced with a piece of chromosome
(or a whole one) missing, or with an extra piece (or whole
chromosome) present.</p>
<p>In 1959, such a situation was found to exist in the case of
persons suffering from a long-known disease called Down&rsquo;s
syndrome.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> Each person so afflicted has 47 chromosomes
in place of the normal 46. It turned out that the 21st pair of
chromosomes (using a convention whereby the chromosome
pairs are numbered in order of decreasing size) consists
of three individuals rather than two. The existence of this
chromosome abnormality clearly demonstrated what had
previously been strongly suspected&mdash;that Down&rsquo;s syndrome
originates as a mutation and is inborn (see the <a href="#pic_10">figure</a> on the
next page).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>

<p class="caption small"><i>Karyotype of a female patient with Down&rsquo;s syndrome (Mongolism).

just one, went to the ovum. Fertilization added the father&rsquo;s chromosome,
which made three Nos. 21 instead of the normal pair.
(Compare with the normal karyotype on <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>Most mutations, however, are not associated with any
noticeable change in chromosome structure. There are,
instead, more subtle changes in the chemical structure of
the genes that make up the chromosome. Then we have
<i>gene mutations</i>.</p>
<p>The process by which a gene produces its own replica is
complicated and, while it rarely goes wrong, it does misfire
on occasion. Then, too, even when a gene molecule is
replicated perfectly, it may undergo change afterward
through the action upon it of some chemical or other environmental
influence. In either case, a new variety of a
particular gene is produced and, if present in a sex cell, it
may be passed on to descendants through an indefinite
number of generations.</p>
<p>Of course, chromosome or gene mutations may take
place in ordinary cells rather than in sex cells. Such
changes in ordinary cells are <i>somatic mutations</i>. When
mutated body cells divide, new cells with changed characteristics
are produced. These changes may be trivial,
or they may be serious. It is often suggested, for instance,
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
that cancer may result from a somatic mutation in which
certain cells lose the capacity to regulate their growth
properly. Since somatic mutations do not involve the sex
cells, they are confined to the individual and are not
passed on to the offspring.</p>
<h3 id="c8">Spontaneous Mutations</h3>
<p>Mutations that take place in the ordinary course of nature,
without man&rsquo;s interference, are <i>spontaneous mutations</i>.
Most of these arise out of the very nature of the
complicated mechanism of gene replication. Copies of genes
are formed out of a large number of small units that must
be lined up in just the right pattern to form one particular
gene and no other.</p>
<p>Ideally, matters are so arranged within the cell that the
necessary changes giving rise to the desired pattern are
just those that have a maximum probability. Other changes
are less likely to happen but are not absolutely excluded.
Sometimes through the accidental jostling of molecules a
wrong turn may be taken, and the result is a spontaneous
mutation.</p>
<p>We might consider a mutation to be either &ldquo;good&rdquo; or
&ldquo;bad&rdquo; in the sense that any change that helps a creature
live more easily and comfortably is good and that the
reverse is bad.</p>
<p>It seems reasonable that random changes in the gene
pattern are almost sure to be bad. Consider that any creature,
including man, is the product of millions of years of
evolution. In every generation those individuals with a gene
pattern that fit them better for their environment won out
over those with less effective patterns&mdash;won out in the
race for food, for mates, and for safety. The &ldquo;more fit&rdquo;
had more offspring and crowded out the &ldquo;less fit&rdquo;.</p>
<p>By now, then, the set of genes with which we are normally
equipped is the end product of long ages of such
<i>natural selection</i>. A random change cannot be expected to
improve it any more than random changes would improve
any very complex, intricate, and delicate structure.</p>

<p>Yet over the eons, creatures have indeed changed,
largely through the effects of mutation. If mutations are
almost always for the worse, how can one explain that
evolution seems to progress toward the better and that
out of a primitive form as simple as an amoeba, for instance,
there eventually emerged man?</p>
<p>In the first place, environment is not fixed. Climate
changes, conditions change, the food supply may change,
the nature of living enemies may change. A gene pattern
that is very useful under one set of conditions may be less
useful under another.</p>
<p>Suppose, for instance, that man had lived in tropical
areas for thousands of years and had developed a heavily
pigmented skin as a protection against sunburn. Any child
who, through a mutation, found himself incapable of forming
much pigment, would be at a severe disadvantage in
the outdoor activities engaged in by his tribe. He would
not do well and such a mutated gene would never establish
itself for long.</p>
<p>If a number of these men migrated to northern Europe,
however, children with dark skin would absorb insufficient
sunlight during the long winter when the sun was low in the
sky, and visible for brief periods only. Dark-skinned
children would, under such conditions, tend to suffer from
rickets.</p>
<p>Mutant children with pale skin would absorb more of
what weak sunlight there was and would suffer less. There
would be little danger of sunburn so there would be no
penalty counteracting this new advantage of pale skins. It
would be the dark-skinned people who would tend to die
out. In the end, you would have dark skins in Africa and
pale skins in Scandinavia, and both would be &ldquo;fit&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the same way, any child born into a primitive hunting
society who found himself with a mutated gene that brought
about nearsightedness would be at a distinct disadvantage.
In a modern technological society, however, nearsighted
individuals, doing more poorly at outdoor games, are often
driven into quieter activities that involve reading, thinking,
and studying. This may lead to a career as a scientist,
scholar, or professional man, categories that are valuable
in such a society and are encouraged. Nearsightedness
would therefore spread more generally through civilized
societies than through primitive ones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Then, too, a gene may be advantageous when it occurs in
low numbers and disadvantageous when it occurs in high
numbers. Suppose there were a gene among humans that
so affected the personality as to make it difficult for a
human being to endure crowded conditions. Such individuals
would make good explorers, farmers, and herdsmen, but
poor city dwellers. Even in our modern urbanized society,
such a gene in moderate concentration would be good, since
we still need our outdoorsmen. In high concentration, it
would be bad, for then the existence of areas of high population
density (on which our society now seems to depend)
might become impossible.</p>
<p>In any species, then, each gene exists in a number of
varieties upon which an absolute &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; cannot
be unequivocally stamped. These varieties make up the
<i>gene pool</i>, and it is this gene pool that makes evolution
possible.</p>
<p>A species with an invariable set of genes could not
change to suit altered conditions. Even a slight shift in
the nature of the environment might suffice to wipe it out.</p>
<p>The possession of a gene pool lends flexibility, however.
As conditions change, one combination of varieties might
gain over another and this, in turn, might produce changes
in body characteristics that would then further alter the
relative &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; or &ldquo;badness&rdquo; of certain gene patterns.</p>
<p>Thus, over the past million years, for example, the
human brain has, through mutations and appropriate shifts
in emphasis within the gene pool, increased notably in size.</p>
<h3 id="c9">Genetic Load</h3>
<p>Some gene mutations produce characteristics so undesirable
that it is difficult to imagine any reasonable change
in environmental conditions that would make them beneficial.
There are mutations that lead to the nondevelopment
of hands and feet, to the production of blood that will not
clot, to serious malformations of essential organs, and so
on. Such mutations are unqualifiedly bad.</p>
<p>The badness may be so severe that a fertilized ovum
may be incapable of development; or, if it develops, the
fetus miscarries or the child is stillborn; or, if the child is
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
born alive, it dies before it matures so that it can never
have children of its own. Any mutation that brings about
death before the gene producing it can be passed on to
another generation is a <i>lethal mutation</i>.</p>
<p>A gene governing a lethal characteristic may be dominant.
It will then kill even though the corresponding gene
on the other chromosome of the pair is normal. Under such
conditions, the lethal gene is removed in the same generation
in which it is formed.</p>
<p>The lethal gene may, on the other hand, be recessive. Its
effect is then not evident if the gene it is paired with is
normal. The normal gene carries on for both.</p>
<p>When this is the case, the lethal gene will remain in
existence and will, every once in a while, make itself evident.
If two people, each serving as a <i>carrier</i> for such a
gene, have children, a sperm cell carrying a lethal may
fertilize an egg cell carrying the same type of lethal, with
sad results.</p>
<p>Every species, including man, includes individuals who
carry undesirable genes. These undesirable genes may be
passed along for generations, even if dominant, before
natural selection culls them out. The more seriously undesirable
they are, the more quickly they are removed, but
even outright lethal genes will be included among the
chromosomes from generation to generation provided they
are recessive. These deleterious genes make up the
<i>genetic load</i>.</p>
<p>The only way to avoid a genetic load is to have no mutations
and therefore no gene pool. The gene pool is necessary
for the flexibility that will allow a species to survive
and evolve over the eons and the genetic load is the price
that must be paid for that. Generally, the capacity for a
species to reproduce itself is sufficiently high to make up,
quite easily, the numbers lost through the combination of
deleterious genes.</p>
<p>The size of a genetic load depends on two factors: The
rate at which a deleterious gene is produced through mutation,
and the rate at which it is removed by natural selection.
When the rate of removal equals the rate of production,
a condition of <i>genetic equilibrium</i> is reached and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
level of occurrence of that gene then remains stable over
the generations.</p>
<p>Even though deleterious genes are removed relatively
rapidly, if dominant, and lethal genes are removed in the
same generation in which they are formed, a new crop of
deleterious genes will appear by mutation with every succeeding
generation. The equilibrium level for such dominant
deleterious genes is relatively low, however.</p>
<p>Deleterious genes that are recessive are removed much
more slowly. Those persons with two such genes, who alone
show the bad effects, are like the visible portion of an iceberg
and represent only a small part of the whole. The
heterozygotes, or carriers, who possess a single gene of
this sort, and who live out normal lives, keep that gene in
being. If people in a particular population marry randomly
and if one out of a million is born homozygous for a certain
deleterious recessive gene (and dies of it), one out of
five hundred is heterozygous for that same gene, shows
no ill effects, and is capable of passing it on.</p>
<p>It may be that the heterozygote is not quite normal but
does show some ill effects&mdash;not enough to incommode him
seriously, perhaps, but enough to lower his chances slightly
for mating and bearing children. In that case, the equilibrium
level for that gene will be lower than it would otherwise
be.</p>
<p>It may also be that the heterozygote experiences an actual
advantage over the normal individual under some conditions.
There is a recessive gene, for instance, that produces
a serious disease called sickle-cell anemia. People
possessing two such genes usually die young. A heterozygote
possessing only one of these genes is not seriously
affected and has red blood cells that are, apparently, less
appetizing to malaria parasites. The heterozygote therefore
experiences a positive advantage if he lives in a region
where the incidence of certain kinds of malaria is
high. The equilibrium level of the sickle-cell anemia gene
can, in other words, be higher in malarial regions than
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Here is one subject area in which additional research is
urgently needed. It may be that the usefulness of a single
deleterious gene is greater than we may suspect in many
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
cases, and that there are greater advantages to heterozygousness
than we know. This may be the basis of what is
sometimes called &ldquo;hybrid vigor&rdquo;. In a world in which
human beings are more mobile than they have ever been
in history and in which intercultural marriages are increasingly
common, information on this point is particularly
important.</p>
<h3 id="c10">Mutation Rates</h3>
<p>It is easier to observe the removal of genes through
death or through failure to reproduce than to observe
their production through mutation. It is particularly difficult
to study their production in human beings, since men
have comparatively long lifetimes and few children, and
since their mating habits cannot well be controlled.</p>
<p>For this reason, geneticists have experimented with
species much simpler than man&mdash;smaller organisms that
are short-lived, produce many offspring, and that can be
penned up and allowed to mate only under fixed conditions.
Such creatures may have fewer chromosomes than man
does and the sites of mutation are more easily pinned
down.</p>
<p>An important assumption made in such experiments is
that the machinery of inheritance and mutation is essentially
the same in all creatures and that therefore knowledge
gained from very simple species (even from bacteria)
is applicable to man. There is overwhelming evidence to
indicate that this is true in general, although there are
specific instances where it is not completely true and
scientists must tread softly while drawing conclusions.</p>
<p>The animals most commonly used in studies of genetics
and mutations are certain species of fruit flies, called
<i>Drosophila</i>. The American geneticist, Hermann J. Muller,
devised techniques whereby he could study the occurrence
of lethal mutations anywhere along one of the four pairs
of chromosomes possessed by <i>Drosophilia</i>.</p>
<p>A lethal gene, he found, might well be produced somewhere
along the length of a particular chromosome once
out of every two hundred times that chromosome underwent
replication. This means that out of every 200 sex
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
cells produced by <i>Drosophilia</i>, one would contain a lethal
gene somewhere along the length of that chromosome.</p>

<p class="caption small"><i>Geneticist Hermann J. Muller studying</i> Drosophila <i>in his laboratory.
Dr. Muller won a Nobel Prize in 1946 for showing that radiation
can cause mutations. (See <a href="#Page_34">page 34</a>.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>That particular chromosome, however, contained at least
500 genes capable of undergoing a lethal mutation. If each
of those genes is equally likely to undergo such a mutation,
then the chance that any one particular gene is lethal is one
out of 200 &times; 500, or 1 out of 100,000.</p>
<p>This is a typical mutation rate for a gene in higher
organisms generally, as far as geneticists can tell (though
the rates are lower among bacteria and viruses). Naturally,
a chance for mutation takes place every time a new individual
is born. Fruit flies have many more offspring
per year than human beings, since their generations are
shorter and they produce more young at a time. For that
reason, though the mutation rate may be the same in fruit
flies as in man, many more actual mutations are produced
per unit time in fruit flies than in men.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the situation may be ignored in
the case of man. Suppose the rate for production of a particular
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
deleterious gene in man is 1 out of 100,000. It is
estimated that a human being has at least 10,000 different
genes, and therefore the chance that at least one of the
genes in a sex cell is deleterious is 10,000 out of 100,000
or 1 out of 10.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is estimated that the number of gene
mutations that are weakly deleterious are four times as
numerous as those that are strongly deleterious or lethal.
The chances that at least one gene in a sex cell is at least
weakly deleterious then would be 4 + 1 out of 10, or 1 out of
2.</p>
<p>Naturally, these deleterious genes are not necessarily
spread out evenly among human beings with one to a sex
cell. Some sex cells will be carrying more than one, thus
increasing the number that may be expected to carry none
at all. Even so, it is supposed that very nearly half the sex
cells produced by humanity carry at least one deleterious
gene.</p>
<p>Even though only half the sex cells are free of deleterious
genes, it is still possible to produce a satisfactory new
generation of men. Yet one can see that the genetic load is
quite heavy and that anything that would tend to increase it
would certainly be undesirable, and perhaps even dangerous.</p>
<p>We tend to increase the genetic load by reducing the rate
at which deleterious genes are removed, that is, by taking
care of the sick and retarded, and by trying to prevent
discomfort and death at all levels.</p>
<p>There is, however, no humane alternative to this. What&rsquo;s
more, it is, by and large, only those with slightly deleterious
genes who are preserved genetically. It is those persons
with nearsightedness, with diabetes, and so on, who,
with the aid of glasses, insulin, or other props, can go on
to live normal lives and have children in the usual numbers.
Those with strongly deleterious genes either die
despite all that can be done for them even today or, at the
least, do not have a chance to have many children.</p>
<p>The danger of an increase in the genetic load rests more
heavily, then, at the other end&mdash;at measures that (usually
inadvertently or unintentionally) increase the rate of production
of mutant genes. It is to this matter we will now
turn.</p>

<h2 id="c11">RADIATION</h2>
<h3 id="c12">Ionizing Radiation</h3>
<p>Our modern technological civilization exposes mankind to
two general types of genetic dangers unknown earlier:
Synthetic chemicals (or unprecedentedly high concentrations
of natural ones) absent in earlier eras, and intensities
of energetic radiation equally unknown or unprecedented.</p>
<p>Chemicals can interfere with the process of replication
by offering alternate pathways with which the cellular
machinery is not prepared to cope. In general, however, it
is only those cells in direct contact with the chemicals that
are so affected, such as the skin, the intestinal linings, the
lungs, and the liver (which is active in altering and getting
rid of foreign chemicals). These may undergo somatic
mutations, and an increased incidence of cancer in those
tissues is among the drastic results of exposure to certain
chemicals.</p>
<p>Such chemicals are not, however, likely to come in contact
with the gonads where the sex cells are produced.
While individual persons may be threatened by the manner
in which the environment is being permeated with novel
chemicals, the next generation is not affected in advance.</p>
<p>Radiation is another matter. In its broadest sense, radiation
is any phenomenon spreading out from some source
in all directions. Physically, such radiation may consist
of waves or of particles.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> Of the wave forms the two best-known
are sound and electromagnetic radiations.</p>
<p>Sound carries very low concentrations of energy. This
energy is absorbed by living tissue and converted into heat.
Heat in itself can increase the mutation rate but the effect
is a small one. The body has effective machinery for keeping
its temperature constant and the gonads are not likely
to suffer unduly from exposure to heat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Electromagnetic radiation comes in a wide range of
energies, with visible light (the best-known example of
such radiation because we can detect it directly and with
great sensitivity) about in the middle of the range. Electromagnetic
radiations less energetic than light (such as
infrared waves and microwaves) are converted into heat
when absorbed by living tissue. The heat thus formed is
sufficient to cause atoms and molecules to vibrate more
rapidly, but this added vibration is not usually sufficient to
pull molecules apart and therefore does not bring about
chemical changes.</p>
<p>Light will bring about some chemical changes. It is
energetic enough to cause a mixture of hydrogen and chlorine
to explode. It will break up silver compounds and
produce tiny black grains of metallic silver (the chemical
basis of photography). Living tissue, however, is largely
unaffected&mdash;the retina of the eye being one obvious exception.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet light, which is more energetic than visible
light, correspondingly can bring about chemical changes
more easily. It will redden the skin, stimulate the production
of pigment, and break up certain steroid molecules to
form vitamin D. It will even interfere with replication to
some extent. At least there is evidence that persistent
exposure to sunlight brings about a heightened tendency
to skin cancer. Ultraviolet light is not very penetrating,
however, and its effects are confined to the skin.</p>
<p>Electromagnetic radiations more energetic than ultraviolet
light, such as X rays and gamma rays, carry sufficient
concentrations of energy to bring about changes not
only in molecules but in the very structure of the atoms
making up those molecules.</p>
<p>Atoms consist of particles (electrons), each carrying a
negative electric charge and circling a tiny centrally located
nucleus, which carries a positive electric charge.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, the negative charges of the electrons just
balance the positive charge on the nucleus so that atoms
and molecules tend to be electrically neutral. An X ray or
gamma ray, crashing into an atom, will, however, jar
electrons loose. What is left of the atom will carry a
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
positive electric charge with the charge size proportional
to the number of electrons lost.</p>
<p>An atom fragment carrying an electric charge is called
an <i>ion</i>. X rays and gamma rays are therefore examples of
<i>ionizing radiation</i>.</p>
<p>Radiations may consist of flying particles, too, and if
these carry sufficient energy they are also ionizing in
character. Examples are <i>cosmic rays</i>, <i>alpha rays</i>, and <i>beta
rays</i>. Cosmic rays are streams of positively charged
nuclei, predominantly those of the element hydrogen. Alpha
rays are streams of positively charged helium nuclei.
Beta rays are streams of negatively charged electrons.
The individual particles contained in these rays may be
referred to as <i>cosmic particles</i>, <i>alpha particles</i>, and <i>beta
particles</i>, respectively.</p>

<p class="caption small"><i>Beta particles originating at left leave these tracks in a cloud

of alpha particles. As the particle slows down, its path becomes
more erratic and the ions are formed closer together. At the very
end of an electron track the proximity of the ions approximates
that in an alpha-particle track.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Ionizing radiation is capable of imparting so much energy
to molecules as to cause them to vibrate themselves
apart, producing not only ions but also high-energy uncharged
molecular fragments called <i>free radicals</i>.</p>
<p>The direct effect of ionizing radiation on chromosomes
can be serious. Enough chemical bonds may be disrupted
so that a chromosome struck by a high-energy wave or
particle may break into fragments. Even if the chromosome
manages to remain intact, an individual gene along
its length may be badly damaged and a mutation may be
produced.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_16">

<p class="caption small"><i>Effects of ionizing radiation on chromosomes: Left, a normal
plant cell showing chromosomes divided into two groups; right,
the same type of cell after X-ray exposure, showing broken fragments
and bridges between groups, typical abnormalities induced
by radiation.</i></p>
</div>
<p>If only direct hits mattered, radiation effects would be
less dangerous than they are, since such direct hits are
comparatively few. However, near-misses may also be
deadly. A streaking bit of radiation may strike a water
molecule near a gene and may break up the molecule to
form a free radical. The free radical will be sufficiently
energetic to bring about a chemical reaction with almost
any molecule it strikes. If it happens to strike the neighboring
gene before it has disposed of that energy, it will
produce the mutation as surely as the original radiation
might have.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Furthermore, ionizing radiations (particularly of the
electromagnetic variety) tend to be penetrating, so that the
interior of the body is as exposed as is the surface. The
gonads cannot hide from X rays, gamma rays, or cosmic
particles.</p>
<p>All these radiations can bring about somatic mutations&mdash;all
can cause cancer, for instance.</p>
<p>What is worse, all of them increase the rate of genetic
mutations so that their presence threatens generations
unborn as well as the individuals actually exposed.</p>
<h3 id="c13">Background Radiation</h3>
<p>Ionizing radiation in low intensities is part of our
natural environment. Such natural radiation is referred to
as <i>background radiation</i>. Part of it arises from certain
constituents of the soil. Atoms of the heavy metals, uranium
and thorium, are constantly, though very slowly,
breaking down and in the process giving off alpha rays,
beta rays, and gamma rays. These elements, while not
among the most common, are very widely spread; minerals
containing small quantities of uranium and thorium
are to be found nearly everywhere.</p>
<p>In addition, all the earth is bombarded with cosmic rays
from outer space and with streams of high-energy particles
from the sun.</p>
<p>Various units can be used to measure the intensity of
this background radiation. The <i>roentgen</i>, abbreviated <i>r</i>, and
named in honor of the discoverer of X rays, Wilhelm
Roentgen, is a unit based on the number of ions produced
by radiation. Rather more convenient is another unit that
has come more recently into prominence. This is the
<i>rad</i> (an abbreviation for &ldquo;radiation absorbed dose&rdquo;) that
is a measure of the amount of energy delivered to the body
upon the absorption of a particular dose of ionizing radiation.
One rad is very nearly equal to one roentgen.</p>
<p>Since background radiation is undoubtedly one of the
factors in producing spontaneous mutations, it is of interest
to try to determine how much radiation a man or woman
will have absorbed from the time he is first conceived to
the time he conceives his own children. The average length
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
of time between generations is taken to be about 30 years,
so we can best express absorption of background radiation
in units of <i>rads per 30 years</i>.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_17">
<img src="images/p12.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="625" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Natural radioactivity in the atmosphere is shown by this nuclear-emulsion
photograph of alpha-particle tracks (enlarged 2000
diameters) emitted by a grain of radioactive dust.</i></p>
</div>
<p>The intensity of background radiation varies from place
to place on the earth for several reasons. Cosmic rays are
deflected somewhat toward the magnetic poles by the
earth&rsquo;s magnetic field. They are also absorbed by the
atmosphere to some extent. For this reason, people living
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
in equatorial regions are less exposed to cosmic rays
than those in polar regions; and those in the plains, with a
greater thickness of atmosphere above them, are less exposed
than those on high plateaus.</p>
<p>Then, too, radioactive minerals may be spread widely,
but they are not spread evenly. Where they are concentrated
to a greater extent than usual, background radiation
is abnormally high.</p>
<p>Thus, an inhabitant of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, may
absorb 2.64 rads per 30 years, while one of Denver, Colorado,
a mile high at the foot of the Rockies, may absorb
5.04 rads per 30 years. Greater extremes are encountered
at such places as Kerala, India, where nearby soil, rich in
thorium minerals, so increases the intensity of background
radiation that as much as 84 rads may be absorbed in 30
years.</p>
<p>In addition to high-energy radiation from the outside,
there are sources within the body itself. Some of the
potassium and carbon atoms of our body are inevitably
radioactive. As much as 0.5 rad per 30 years arises from
this source.</p>
<p>Rads and roentgens are not completely satisfactory units
in estimating the biological effects of radiation. Some types
of radiation&mdash;those made up of comparatively large particles,
for instance&mdash;are more effective in producing ions
and bring about molecular changes with greater ease than
do electromagnetic radiations delivering equal energy to
the body. Thus if 1 rad of alpha particles is absorbed by
the body, 10 to 20 times as much biological effect is produced
as there would be in the absorption of 1 rad of
X rays, gamma rays, or beta particles.</p>
<p>Sometimes, then, one speaks of the <i>relative biological
effectiveness</i> (RBE) of radiation, or the <i>roentgen equivalent,
man</i> (rem). A rad of X rays, gamma rays, or beta
particles has a rem of 1, while a rad of alpha particles
has a rem of 10 to 20.</p>
<p>If we allow for the effect of the larger particles (which
are not very common under ordinary conditions) we can
estimate that the gonads of the average human being receive
a total dose of natural radiation of about 3 rems per
30 years. This is just about an irreducible minimum.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h3 id="c14">Man-made Radiation</h3>
<p>Man began to add to the background radiation in the
1890s. In 1895, X rays were discovered and since then have
become increasingly useful in medical diagnosis and therapy
and in industry. In 1896, radioactivity was discovered
and radioactive substances were concentrated in laboratories
in order that they might be studied. In 1934, it was
found that radioactive forms of nonradioactive elements
(<i>radioisotopes</i>) could be formed and their use came to be
widespread in universities, hospitals, and industries.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Then, in 1945, the nuclear bomb was developed. With the
uranium or plutonium fission that produces a nuclear explosion,
there is an accompaniment of intense gamma
radiation. In addition, a variety of radioisotopes are left
behind in the form of the residue (<i>fission fragments</i>) of
the fissioning atoms. These fission fragments are distributed
widely in the atmosphere. Some rise high into the
stratosphere and descend (as <i>fallout</i>) over the succeeding
months and years.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>It is hard to try to estimate how much additional radiation
is being absorbed by human beings out of these man-made
sources. Fallout is not uniformly spread over the
earth but is higher in those latitudes where nuclear bombs
have been most frequently tested. Then, too, people in
industries and research who are involved with the use of
radioisotopes, and people in medical centers who constantly
deal with X rays, are likely to get more exposure than
others.</p>
<p>These adjuncts of modern science and medicine are more
common and widespread in technologically advanced countries
than elsewhere, and nuclear bombs have most often
been exploded in just those latitudes where the advanced
countries are to be found.</p>
<p>Attempts have been made to work out estimates of this
exposure. One estimate, involving a number of technologically
advanced countries (including the United States)
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
showed that an average of somewhere between 0.02 and
0.18 rem per year was absorbed, as a result of radiations
(usually X rays) used in medical diagnosis and therapy.
Occupational exposure added, on the average, not more
than 0.003 rem, though the individuals constantly exposed
in the course of their work would naturally absorb considerably
more than this overall average.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_18">
<img src="images/p13.jpg" alt="" width="705" height="600" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Man-made radioactivity in the atmosphere produced this nuclear-emulsion
photograph. This radiation source is a fission product
produced in a nuclear explosion. The enlargement is 1200 diameters.
Compare this with the natural radioactivity depicted on <a href="#Page_28">page 28</a>.</i></p>
</div>
<p>On the whole, the highest absorption was found, as was
to be expected, in the United States.</p>
<p>If these findings are expanded to cover a 30-year period,
assuming the absorption will remain the same from year
to year, it turns out that the average absorption of man-made
radiation in the nations studied varies from 0.6 rem
to 5.5 rems per 30 years per individual.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Considering the higher figure to be applicable to the
United States, it would seem that man-made radiation from
all sources is now being absorbed at nearly twice the rate
that natural radiation is. To put it another way, Americans
are just about tripling their radiation dosage by reason of
the human activities that are now adding man-made radiation
to the natural supply. By far the major part of this
additional dosage is the result of the use of X rays in
searching for decayed teeth, broken bones, lung lesions,
swallowed objects, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="c15">DOSE AND CONSEQUENCE</h2>
<h3 id="c16">Radiation Sickness</h3>
<p>The danger to the individual as a result of overexposure
to high-energy radiation was understood fairly soon but not
before some tragic experiences were recorded.</p>
<p>One of the early workers with radioactive materials,
Pierre Curie, deliberately exposed a patch of his skin to
the action of radioactive radiations and obtained a serious
and slow-healing burn. His wife, Marie Curie, and their
daughter, Ir&egrave;ne Joliot-Curie, who spent their lives working
with radioactive materials, both died of leukemia, very
possibly as the result of cumulative exposure to radiation.
Other research workers in the field died of cancer before
the full necessity of extreme caution was understood.</p>
<p>The damage done to human beings by radiation could
first be studied on a large scale among the survivors of
the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
Here marked symptoms of <i>radiation sickness</i> were observed.
This sickness often leads to death, though a slow
recovery is sometimes possible.</p>
<p>In general, high-energy radiation damages the complex
molecules within a cell, interfering with its chemical
machinery to the point, in extreme cases, of killing it.
(Thus, cancers, which cannot safely be reached with the
surgeon&rsquo;s knife, are sometimes exposed to high-energy
radiation in the hope that the cancer cells will be effectively
killed in that manner.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The delicate structure of the genes and chromosomes is
particularly vulnerable to the impact of high-energy radiation.
Chromosomes can be broken by such radiation and
this is the main cause of actual cell death. A cell that is
not killed outright by radiation may nevertheless be so
damaged as to be unable to undergo replication and mitosis.</p>
<p>If a cell is of a type that will not, in the course of nature,
undergo division, the destruction of the mitosis machinery
is not in itself fatal to the organism. A creature like
<i>Drosophila</i>, which, in its adult stage, has very few cell
divisions going on among the ordinary cells of its body,
can survive radiation doses a hundred times as great as
would suffice to kill a man.</p>
<p>In a human being, however&mdash;even in an adult who is no
longer experiencing overall growth&mdash;there are many tissues
whose cells must undergo division throughout life.
Hair and fingernails grow constantly, as a result of cell
division at their roots. The outer layers of skin are steadily
lost through abrasion and are replaced through constant
cell division in the deeper layers. The same is true of the
lining of the mouth, throat, stomach, and intestines. Too,
blood cells are continually breaking up and must be replaced
in vast numbers.</p>
<p>If radiation kills the mechanism of division in only some
of these cells, it is possible that those that remain reasonably
intact can divide and eventually replace or do the
work of those that can no longer divide. In that case, the
symptoms of radiation sickness are relatively mild in the
first place and eventually disappear.</p>
<p>Past a certain critical point, when too many cells are
made incapable of division, this is no longer possible. The
symptoms, which show up in the growing tissues particularly
(as in the loss of hair, the misshaping or loss of
fingernails, the reddening and hemorrhaging of skin, the
ulceration of the mouth, and the lowering of the blood cell
count), grow steadily more severe and death follows.</p>
<h3 id="c17">Radiation and Mutation</h3>
<p>Where radiation is insufficient to render a cell incapable
of division, it may still induce mutations, and it is in this
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
fashion that skin cancer, leukemia, and other disorders
may be brought about.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>

</div>
<p>Mutations can be brought about in the sex cells, too, of
course, and when this happens it is succeeding generations
that are affected and not merely the exposed individual.
Indeed, where the sex cells are concerned, the relatively
mild effect of mutation is more serious than the drastic
one of nondivision. A fertilized ovum that cannot divide
eventually dies and does no harm; one that can divide but
is altered, may give rise to an individual with one of the
usual kinds of major or minor physical defects.</p>
<p>The effect of high-energy radiation on the genetic mechanism
was first demonstrated experimentally in 1927 by
Muller. Using <i>Drosophila</i> he showed that after large doses
of X rays, flies experienced many more lethal mutations
per chromosome than did similar flies not exposed to radiation.
The drastic differences he observed proved the
connection between radiation and mutation at once.</p>
<p>Later experiments, by Muller and by others, showed that
the number of mutations was directly proportional to the
quantity of radiation absorbed. Doubling the quantity of
radiation absorbed doubled the number of mutations, tripling
the one tripled the other, and so on. This means that
if the number of mutations is plotted against the amount of
radiation absorbed, a straight line can be drawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>It is generally believed that the straight line continues
all the way down without deviation to very low radiation
absorptions. This means there is no &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; for the
mutational effect of radiation. No matter how small a
dosage of radiation the gonads receive, this will be reflected
in a proportionately increased likelihood of mutated
sex cells with effects that will show up in succeeding
generations.</p>
<p>In this respect, the genetic effect of radiation is quite
different from the somatic effect. A small dose of radiation
may affect growing tissues and prevent a small proportion
of the cells of those tissues from dividing. The
remaining, unaffected cells take up the slack, however,
and if the proportion of affected cells is small enough,
symptoms are not visible and never become visible. There
is thus a threshold effect: The radiation absorbed must be
more than a certain amount before any somatic symptoms
are manifest.</p>
<p>Matters are quite different where the genetic effect is
concerned. If a sex cell is damaged and if that sex cell is
one of the pair that goes into the production of a fertilized
ovum, a damaged organism results. There is no margin
for correction. There is no unaffected cell that can take
over the work of the damaged sex cell once fertilization
has taken place.</p>
<p>Suppose only one sex cell out of a million is damaged.
If so, a damaged sex cell will, on the average, take part in
one out of every million fertilizations. And when it is used,
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
it will not matter that there are 999,999 perfectly good sex
cells that might have been used&mdash;it was the damaged cell
that <i>was</i> used. That is why there is no threshold in the
genetic effect of radiation and why there is no &ldquo;safe&rdquo;
amount of radiations insofar as genetic effects are concerned.
However small the quantity of radiation absorbed,
mankind must be prepared to pay the price in a corresponding
increase of the genetic load.</p>

<p>If the straight line obtained by plotting mutation rate
against radiation dose is followed down to a radiation dose
of zero, it is found that
the line strikes the vertical
axis slightly above the
origin. The mutation rate
is more than zero even
when the radiation dose is
zero. The reason for this
is that it is the dose of
man-made radiation that
is being considered. Even
when man-made radiation
is completely absent there
still remains the natural
background radiation.</p>
<p>It is possible in this manner to determine that background
radiation accounts for considerably less than 1% of the
spontaneous mutations that take place. The other mutations
must arise out of chemical misadventures, out of the random
heat-jiggling of molecules, and so on. These, it can be
presumed, will remain constant when the radiation dose is
increased.</p>
<p>This is a hopeful aspect of the situation for it means that,
if the background radiation is doubled or tripled for mankind
as a whole, only that small portion of the spontaneous
mutation rate that is due to the background radiation will
be doubled or tripled.</p>
<p>Let us suppose, for instance, that fully 1% of the spontaneous
mutations occurring in mankind is due to background
radiation. In that case, the tripling of the background
radiation produced in the United States by man-made
causes (see <a href="#table1">Table</a>) would triple that 1%. In place of 99 non-radiational
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
mutations plus 1 radiational, we would have
99 plus 3. The total number of mutations would increase
from 100 to 102&mdash;an increase of 2%, not an increase of
200% that one would expect if all spontaneous mutations
were caused by background radiation.</p>

<h3 id="c18">Dosage Rates</h3>
<p>Another difference between the genetic and somatic effects
of radiation rests in the response to changes in the
rate at which radiation is absorbed. It makes a considerable
difference to the body whether a large dose of radiation
is absorbed over the space of a few minutes or a few
years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>When a large dose is absorbed over a short interval of
time, so many of the growing tissues lose the capacity for
cell division that death may follow. If the same dose is
delivered over years, only a small bit of radiation is absorbed
on any given day and only small proportions of
growing cells lose the capacity for division at any one
time. The unaffected cells will continually make up for this
and will replace the affected ones. The body is, so to speak,
continually repairing the radiation damage and no serious
symptoms will develop.</p>
<p>Then, too, if a moderate dose is delivered, the body may
show visible symptoms of radiation sickness but can recover.
It will then be capable of withstanding another
moderate dose, and so on.</p>
<p>The situation is quite different with respect to the genetic
effects, at least as far as experiments with <i>Drosophila</i> and
bacteria seem to show. Even the smallest doses will produce
a few mutations in the chromosomes of those cells in
the gonads that eventually develop into sex cells. The
affected gonad cells will continue to produce sex cells with
those mutations for the rest of the life of the organism.
Every tiny bit of radiation adds to the number of mutated
sex cells being constantly produced. There is no recovery,
because the sex cells, after formation, do not work in
cooperation, and affected cells are not replaced by those
that are unaffected.</p>
<p>This means (judging by the experiments on lower creatures)
that what counts, where genetic damage is in question,
is not the rate at which radiation is absorbed but the
total sum of radiation. Every exposure an organism experiences,
however small, adds its bit of damage.</p>
<p>Accepting this hard view, it would seem important to
make every effort to minimize radiation exposure for the
population generally.</p>
<p>Since most of the man-made increase in background
radiation is the result of the use of X rays in medical
diagnosis and therapy, many geneticists are looking at this
with suspicion and concern. No one suggests that their use
be abandoned, for certainly such techniques are important
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
in the saving of life and the mitigation of suffering. Still,
X rays ought not to be used lightly, or routinely as a matter
of course.</p>
<p>It might seem that X rays applied to the jaw or the chest
would not affect the gonads, and this might be so if all the
X rays could indeed be confined to the portion of the body
at which they are aimed. Unfortunately, X rays do not
uniformly travel a straight line in passing through matter.
They are scattered to a certain extent; if a stream of
X rays passes through the body anywhere, or even through
objects near the body, some X rays will be scattered
through the gonads.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that some geneticists suggest that
the history of exposure to X rays be kept carefully for each
person. A decision on a new exposure would then be determined
not only by the current situation but by the individual&rsquo;s
past history.</p>
<p>Such considerations were also an important part of the
driving force behind the movement to end atmospheric
testing of nuclear bombs. While the total addition to the
background radiation resulting from such tests is small,
the prospect of continued accumulation is unpleasant.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, whereas X rays used in diagnosis and therapy
have a humane purpose and chiefly affect the patient
who hopes to be helped in the process, nuclear fallout affects
all of humanity without distinction and seems, to many
people, to have as its end only the promise of a totally
destructive nuclear war.</p>
<p>It is not to be expected that the large majority of humanity
that makes up the populations outside the United States,
Great Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union can be
expected to accept stoically the risk of even limited quantities
of genetic damage, out of any feeling of loyalty to
nations not their own. Even within the populations of the
three major nuclear powers there are strong feelings that
the possible benefits of nuclear testing do not balance the
certain dangers.</p>
<p>Public opinion throughout the world is a key factor, then,
in enforcing the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, signed by the
governments of the United States, Great Britain, and the
Soviet Union on October 10, 1963.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h3 id="c19">Effects on Mammals</h3>
<p>Although genetic findings on such comparatively simple
creatures as fruit flies and bacteria seem to apply generally
to all forms of life, it seems unsafe to rely on these
findings completely in anything as important as possible
genetic damage to man through radiation. During the
1950s and 1960s, therefore, there have been important
studies on mice, particularly by W. L. Russell at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee.</p>
<p>While not as short-lived or as fecund as fruit flies, mice
can nevertheless produce enough young over a reasonable
period of time to yield statistically useful results. Experimenters
have worked with hundreds of thousands of offspring
born of mice that have been irradiated with gamma
rays and X rays in different amounts and at different intensities,
as well as with additional hundreds of thousands
born to mice that were not irradiated.</p>
<p>Since mice, like men, are mammals, results gained by
such experiments are particularly significant. Mice are
far closer to man in the scheme of life than is any other
creature that has been studied genetically on a large scale,
and their reactions (one might cautiously assume) are
likely to be closer to those that would be found in man.</p>
<p>Almost at once, when the studies began, it turned out that
mice were more susceptible to genetic damage than fruit
flies were. The induced mutation rate per gene seems to be
about fifteen times that found in <i>Drosophila</i> for comparable
X ray doses. The only safe course for mankind then is to
err, if it must, strongly on the side of conservatism. Once
we have decided what might be safe on the basis of <i>Drosophila</i>
studies, we ought then to tighten precautions several
notches by remembering that we are very likely more
vulnerable than fruit flies are.</p>
<p>Counteracting the depressing nature of this finding was
that of a later, quite unexpected discovery. It was well
established that in fruit flies and other simple organisms,
it was the total dosage of absorbed radiation that counted
and that whether this was delivered quickly or slowly did
not matter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<div class="img" id="pic_24">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="687" />
<p class="caption small"><i>Arrangement for long-term
low-dose-rate irradiation
of mice used for mutation-rate
studies at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory. The
cages are arranged at
equal distances from a
cesium-137 gamma-ray
source in the lead pot on
the floor. The horizontal
rod rotates the source.</i></p>
</div>
<p>This proved to be <i>not</i> so in the case of mice. In male
mice, a radiation dose delivered at the rate of 0.009 rad
per minute produced only from one-quarter to one-third
as many mutations as did the same total dose delivered at
90 rads per minute.</p>
<p>In the male, cells in the gonads are constantly dividing
to produce sex cells. The latter are produced by the billions.
It might be, then, that at low radiation dose rates, a
few of the gonad cells are damaged but that the undamaged
ones produce a flood of sperm cells, &ldquo;drowning out&rdquo; the few
produced by the damaged gonad cells. The same radiation
dose delivered in a short time might, however, damage so
many of the gonad cells as to make the damaged sex cells
much more difficult to &ldquo;flood out&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A second possible explanation is that there is present
within the cells themselves some process that tends to
repair damage to the genes and to counteract mutations. It
might be a slow-working, laborious process that could
keep up with the damage inflicted at low dosage rates but
not at high ones. High dosage rates might even damage the
repair mechanism itself. That, too, would account for the
fewer mutations at low dosage rates than at high ones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>To check which of the two possible explanations was
nearer the truth, Russell performed similar tests on female
mice. In the female mouse (or the female human
being, for that matter) the egg cells have completed almost
all their divisions before the female is born. There are
only so many cells in the female gonads that can give rise
to egg cells, and each one gives rise to only a single egg
cell. There is no possibility of damaged egg cells being
drowned out by floods of undamaged ones because there
are no floods.</p>
<p>Yet it was found that in the female mouse the mutation
rate also dropped when the radiation dose rate was decreased.
In fact, it dropped even more drastically than was
the case in the male mouse.</p>
<p>Apparently, then, there must be actual repair within the
cell. There must be some chemical mechanism inside the
cell capable of counteracting radiation damage to some
extent. In the female mouse, the mutation rate drops very
low as the radiation dose rate drops, so that it would seem
that almost all mutations might be repaired, given enough
time. In the male, the mutation rate drops only so far and
no farther, so that some mutations (about one-third is the
best estimate so far) cannot be repaired.</p>
<p>If this is also true in the human being (and it is at least
reasonably likely that it is), then the greater vulnerability
of our genes as compared with those of fruit flies is at
least partially made up for by our greater ability to repair
the damage.</p>
<p>This opens a door for the future, too. The workings of the
gene-repair mechanism ought (it is to be hoped) eventually
to be puzzled out. When it is, methods may be discovered
for reinforcing that mechanism, speeding it, and increasing
its effectiveness. We may then find ourselves no longer
completely helpless in the face of genetic damage, or even
of radiation sickness.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is only fair to point out that the
foregoing appraisal may be an over-optimistic view. Russell&rsquo;s
experiments involved just 7 genes and it is possible
that these are not representative of the thousands that
exist altogether. While the work done so far is most suggestive
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
and interesting, much research remains to be
carried out.</p>
<p>If, then, we cannot help hoping that natural devices for
counteracting radiation damage may be developed in the
future, we must, for the present, remain rigidly cautious.</p>
<h3 id="c20">Conclusion</h3>
<p>It is unrealistic to suppose that all sources of man-made
radiation should be abolished. The good they do now, the
greater good they will do in the future, cannot be abandoned.
It is, however, reasonable to expect that the present
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty will continue and that nations,
such as France and China, which have nuclear capabilities
but are not signatories of the Treaty will eventually sign.
It is also reasonable to expect that X ray diagnosis and
therapy will be carried on with the greatest circumspection,
and that the use of radiation in industry and research
will be carried on with great care and with the use of ample
shielding.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic_25">

<p class="caption small"><i>A film badge (left) and a personal radiation monitor
(right) record the amount of radiation absorbed by

dose and to prevent overexposure.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>As long as man-made radiation exists, there will be some
absorption of it by human beings. The advantages of its use
in our modern society are such that we must be prepared to
pay some price. This is not a matter of callousness. We
have come to depend a great deal for comfort and even for
extended life, upon the achievements of our technology, and
any serious crippling of that technology will cost us lives.
An attempt must be made to balance the values of radiation
against its dangers; we must balance lives against lives.
This involves hard judgments.</p>
<p>Those working under conditions of greatest radiation
risk&mdash;in atomic research, in industrial plants using isotopes,
and so on&mdash;can be allowed to set relatively high
limits for total radiation dosages and dose rates that they
may absorb (with time) with reasonable safety, but such
rates will never do for the population generally. A relative
few can voluntarily endure risks, both somatic and genetic,
that we cannot sanely expect of mankind as a whole.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>From fruit fly experiments it would seem that a total
exposure of 30 to 100 rads of radiation will double the spontaneous
mutation rate. So much radiation and such a doubling
of the rate would be considered intolerable for humanity.</p>
<p>Some geneticists have recommended that the average
total exposure of human beings in the first 30 years of life
be set at 10 rads. Note that this figure is set as a <i>maximum</i>.
Every reasonable method, it is expected, will be
used to allow mankind to fall as far short of this figure as
possible. Note also that the 10-rad figure is an <i>average</i>
maximum. The exposure of some individuals to a greater
total dose would be viewed as tolerable for society if it
were balanced by the exposure of other individuals to a
lesser total dose.</p>
<p>A total exposure of 10 rads might increase the overall
mutation rate, it is roughly estimated, by 10%. This is
serious enough, but is bearable if we can convince ourselves
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
that the alternative of abandoning radiation technology
altogether will cause still greater suffering.</p>
<p>A 10% increase in mutation rate, whatever it might mean
in personal suffering and public expense, is not likely to
threaten the human race with extinction, or even with
serious degeneration.</p>
<p>The human race as a whole may be thought of as somewhat
analogous to a population of dividing cells in a growing
tissue. Those affected by genetic damage drop out and the
slack is taken up by those not affected.</p>
<p>If the number of those affected is increased, there would
come a crucial point, or threshold, where the slack could
no longer be taken up. The genetic load might increase to
the point where the species as a whole would degenerate
and fade toward extinction&mdash;a sort of &ldquo;racial radiation
sickness&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We are not near this threshold now, however, and can,
therefore, as a species, absorb a moderate increase in
mutation rate without danger of extinction.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is <i>not</i> correct to argue, as some do,
that an increase in mutation rate might be actually beneficial.
The argument runs that a higher mutation rate might
broaden the gene pool and make it more flexible, thus
speeding up the course of evolution and hastening the
advent of &ldquo;supermen&rdquo;&mdash;brainier, stronger, healthier than
we ourselves are.</p>
<p>The truth seems to be that the gene pool, as it exists
now, supplies us with all the variability we need for the
effective working of the evolutionary mechanism. That
mechanism is functioning with such efficiency that broadening
the gene pool cannot very well add to it, and if the
hope of increased evolutionary efficiency were the only
reason to tolerate man-made radiation, it would be insufficient.</p>
<p>The situation is rather analogous to that of a man who
owns a good house that is heavily mortgaged. If he were
offered a second house with a similar mortgage, he would
have to refuse. To be sure, he would have twice the number
of houses, but he would not need a second house since
he has all the comfort he can reasonably use in his first
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
house&mdash;and he would not be able to afford a second
mortgage.</p>
<p>What humanity must do, if additional radiation damage is
absolutely necessary, is to take on as little of that added
damage as possible, and not pretend that any direct benefits
will be involved. Any pretense of that sort may well
lure us into assuming still greater damage&mdash;damage we
may not be able to afford under any circumstances and
for any reason.</p>
<p>Actually, as the situation appears right now, it is not
likely that the use of radiation in modern medicine, research,
and industry will overstep the maximum bounds
set by scientists who have weighed the problem carefully.
Only nuclear warfare is likely to do so, and apparently
those governments with large capacities in this direction
are thoroughly aware of the danger and (so far, at least)
have guided their foreign policies accordingly.</p>

when heterozygous. In the case of sickle cell anemia, heterozygotes
are adaptively superior to normal homozygotes. This
makes for balanced polymorphism, by which a gene is retained
in the population despite its lethality when homozygous because
of the advantage it confers when heterozygous.</p>
<p class="book"><i>Gene Structure and Gene Action.</i> The lecturer of this film is G. W.
Beadle of Cornell University. The Watson-Crick structure of
DNA is discussed in terms of mutation. Several tests of the
chain separation hypothesis for DNA replication are described
(experiments with heavy DNA, radioactive chromosomes, and
the replication of DNA in vitro). This working hypothesis is
presented: The coded information in DNA is transferred to
RNA, which serves as a template for polypeptide synthesis.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
