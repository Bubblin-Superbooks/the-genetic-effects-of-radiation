Suppose there were a gene among humans that so affected the personality as to make it difficult for a human being to endure crowded conditions. Such individuals would make good explorers, farmers, and herdsmen, but poor city dwellers. Even in our modern urbanized society, such a gene in moderate concentration would be good, since we still need our outdoorsmen. In high concentration, it would be bad, for then the existence of areas of high population density (on which our society now seems to depend) might become impossible.</p><p>In any species, then, each gene exists in a number of varieties upon which an absolute &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; cannot be unequivocally stamped. These varieties make up the gene pool, and it is this gene pool that makes evolution possible.</p></div> </div>
