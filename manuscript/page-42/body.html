<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>How does the fertilized ovum obtain its particular set of chromosomes in the first place?</p><p>Each adult possesses gonads in which sex cells are formed. In the male, sperm cells are formed in the testes; in the female, egg cells are formed in the ovaries.</p><p>In the formation of the sperm cells and egg cells there is a key step&mdash;meiosis&mdash;a cell division in which the chromosomes group into pairs and are then apportioned between the daughter cells, one of each pair to each cell. Such a division, unaccompanied by replication, means that in place of the usual 23 pairs of chromosomes in each other cell, each sex cell has 23 individual chromosomes, a &ldquo;half-set&rdquo;, so to speak.</p></div> </div>
