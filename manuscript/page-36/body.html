<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Every different pattern of amino acids forms a molecule with its own set of properties, and there are an enormous number of patterns possible. In an enzyme molecule made up of 500 amino acids, the number of possible patterns can be expressed by a 1 followed by 1100 zeroes (10&sup1;&sup1;⁰⁰).</p><p>Every cell has the capacity of choosing among this unimaginable number of possible patterns and selecting those characteristic of itself. It therefore ends with a complement of specific enzymes that guide its own chemical changes and, consequently, its properties and its behavior. The &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; that enable a fertilized ovum to develop in the proper manner are essentially &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; for choosing a particular set of enzyme patterns out of all those possible.</p></div> </div>
