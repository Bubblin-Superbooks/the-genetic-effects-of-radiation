While individual persons may be threatened by the manner in which the environment is being permeated with novel chemicals, the next generation is not affected in advance.</p><p>Radiation is another matter. In its broadest sense, radiation is any phenomenon spreading out from some source in all directions. Physically, such radiation may consist of waves or of particles. Of the wave forms the two best-known are sound and electromagnetic radiations.</p><p>Sound carries very low concentrations of energy. This energy is absorbed by living tissue and converted into heat. Heat in itself can increase the mutation rate but the effect is a small one. The body has effective machinery for keeping its temperature constant and the gonads are not likely to suffer unduly from exposure to heat.</p></div> </div>
