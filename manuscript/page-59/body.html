<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>We might consider a mutation to be either &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; in the sense that any change that helps a creature live more easily and comfortably is good and that the reverse is bad.</p><p>It seems reasonable that random changes in the gene pattern are almost sure to be bad. Consider that any creature, including man, is the product of millions of years of evolution. In every generation those individuals with a gene pattern that fit them better for their environment won out over those with less effective patterns&mdash;won out in the race for food, for mates, and for safety. The &ldquo;more fit&rdquo; had more offspring and crowded out the &ldquo;less fit&rdquo;.</p></div> </div>
