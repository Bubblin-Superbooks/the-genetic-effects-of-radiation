<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In 1959, such a situation was found to exist in the case of persons suffering from a long-known disease called Down&rsquo;s syndrome. Each person so afflicted has 47 chromosomes in place of the normal 46. It turned out that the 21st pair of chromosomes (using a convention whereby the chromosome pairs are numbered in order of decreasing size) consists of three individuals rather than two. The existence of this chromosome abnormality clearly demonstrated what had previously been strongly suspected&mdash;that Down&rsquo;s syndrome originates as a mutation and is inborn (see the on the next page).</p><p>Karyotype of a female patient with Down&rsquo;s syndrome (Mongolism). During meiosis both chromosomes No. 21 of the mother, instead of just one, went to the ovum. Fertilization added the father&rsquo;s chromosome, which made three Nos. 21 instead of the normal pair. (Compare with the normal karyotype on .)</p></div> </div>
