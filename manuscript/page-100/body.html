<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Rather more convenient is another unit that has come more recently into prominence. This is the rad (an abbreviation for &ldquo;radiation absorbed dose&rdquo;) that is a measure of the amount of energy delivered to the body upon the absorption of a particular dose of ionizing radiation. One rad is very nearly equal to one roentgen.</p><p>Since background radiation is undoubtedly one of the factors in producing spontaneous mutations, it is of interest to try to determine how much radiation a man or woman will have absorbed from the time he is first conceived to the time he conceives his own children. The average length 28 of time between generations is taken to be about 30 years, so we can best express absorption of background radiation in units of rads per 30 years.</p></div> </div>
