Even a slight shift in the nature of the environment might suffice to wipe it out.</p><p>The possession of a gene pool lends flexibility, however. As conditions change, one combination of varieties might gain over another and this, in turn, might produce changes in body characteristics that would then further alter the relative &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; or &ldquo;badness&rdquo; of certain gene patterns.</p><p>Thus, over the past million years, for example, the human brain has, through mutations and appropriate shifts in emphasis within the gene pool, increased notably in size.</p></div> </div>
