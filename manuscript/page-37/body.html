<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Genes are therefore usually referred to by the body change they bring about, and one can, for instance, speak of a &ldquo;gene for color blindness&rdquo;.</p><p>A gene may exist in two or more varieties, each producing a slightly different enzyme, a situation that is reflected, in turn, in slight changes in body characteristics. Thus, there are genes governing eye color, one of which is sufficiently important to be considered a &ldquo;gene for blue eyes&rdquo; and another a &ldquo;gene for brown eyes&rdquo;. One or the other, but not both, will be found in a specific place on a specific chromosome.</p><p>The two chromosomes of a particular pair govern identical sets of characteristics. Both, for instance, will have a place for genes governing eye color. If we consider only the most important of the varieties involved, those on each chromosome of the pair may be identical;</p></div> </div>
