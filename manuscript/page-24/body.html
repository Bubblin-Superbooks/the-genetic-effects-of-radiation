<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The average human adult consists of about 50 trillion cells&mdash;50 trillion microscopic, more or less self-contained, blobs of life. He begins life, however, as a single cell, the fertilized ovum.</p><p>After the fertilized ovum is formed, it divides and becomes two cells. Each daughter cell divides to produce a total of four cells, and each of those divides and so on.</p><p>There is a high degree of order and direction to those divisions. When a human fertilized ovum completes its divisions an adult human being is the inevitable result. The fertilized ovum of a giraffe will produce a giraffe, that of a fruit fly will produce a fruit fly, and so on. There 3 are no mistakes, so it is quite clear that the fertilized ovum must carry &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; that guide its development in the appropriate direction.</p></div> </div>
