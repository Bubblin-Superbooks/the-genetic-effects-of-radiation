However small the quantity of radiation absorbed, mankind must be prepared to pay the price in a corresponding increase of the genetic load.</p><p>If the straight line obtained by plotting mutation rate against radiation dose is followed down to a radiation dose of zero, it is found that the line strikes the vertical axis slightly above the origin. The mutation rate is more than zero even when the radiation dose is zero. The reason for this is that it is the dose of man-made radiation that is being considered. Even when man-made radiation is completely absent there still remains the natural background radiation.</p></div> </div>
