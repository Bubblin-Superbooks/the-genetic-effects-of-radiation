Every exposure an organism experiences, however small, adds its bit of damage.</p><p>Accepting this hard view, it would seem important to make every effort to minimize radiation exposure for the population generally.</p><p>Since most of the man-made increase in background radiation is the result of the use of X rays in medical diagnosis and therapy, many geneticists are looking at this with suspicion and concern. No one suggests that their use be abandoned, for certainly such techniques are important 39 in the saving of life and the mitigation of suffering. Still, X rays ought not to be used lightly, or routinely as a matter of course.</p></div> </div>
