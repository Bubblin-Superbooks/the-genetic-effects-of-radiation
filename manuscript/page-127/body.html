This means that if the number of mutations is plotted against the amount of radiation absorbed, a straight line can be drawn.</p><p>35</p><p>It is generally believed that the straight line continues all the way down without deviation to very low radiation absorptions. This means there is no &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; for the mutational effect of radiation. No matter how small a dosage of radiation the gonads receive, this will be reflected in a proportionately increased likelihood of mutated sex cells with effects that will show up in succeeding generations.</p></div> </div>
