<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Atoms consist of particles (electrons), each carrying a negative electric charge and circling a tiny centrally located nucleus, which carries a positive electric charge.</p><p>Ordinarily, the negative charges of the electrons just balance the positive charge on the nucleus so that atoms and molecules tend to be electrically neutral. An X ray or gamma ray, crashing into an atom, will, however, jar electrons loose. What is left of the atom will carry a 24 positive electric charge with the charge size proportional to the number of electrons lost.</p><p>An atom fragment carrying an electric charge is called an ion. X rays and gamma rays are therefore examples of ionizing radiation.</p><p>Radiations may consist of flying particles, too, and if these carry sufficient energy they are also ionizing in character. Examples are cosmic rays, alpha rays, and beta rays.</p></div> </div>
