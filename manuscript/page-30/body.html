The karotype below is of a normal male, since it shows X and Y sex chromosomes and 22 pairs of other, autosomal, chromosomes. By contrast, the cells in the upper pictures are abnormal, with only 45 chromosomes each.</p><p>In this way, the fundamental &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; that determine the characteristics of a cell are passed on to each new cell. Ideally, all the trillions of cells in a particular human being have identical sets of &ldquo;instructions&rdquo;.</p></div> </div>
