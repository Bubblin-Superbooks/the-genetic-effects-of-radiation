If the parents&rsquo; ancestry were traced further back, blue-eyed individuals would undoubtedly be found on both sides of the family tree.</p><p>If, however, there were no record of, say, anything but normal color vision in a child&rsquo;s ancestry, and he were born color-blind, that could be assumed to be the result of a mutation. Such a mutation could then be passed on by the normal modes of inheritance and a certain proportion of the child&rsquo;s eventual descendants would be color-blind.</p><p>A mutation may be associated with changes in chromosome structure sufficiently drastic to be visible under the microscope. Such chromosome mutations can arise in several ways. Chromosomes may undergo replication without the cell itself dividing.</p></div> </div>
