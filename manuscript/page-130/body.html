<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Let us suppose, for instance, that fully 1% of the spontaneous mutations occurring in mankind is due to background radiation. In that case, the tripling of the background radiation produced in the United States by man-made causes (see ) would triple that 1%. In place of 99 non-radiational 37 mutations plus 1 radiational, we would have 99 plus 3. The total number of mutations would increase from 100 to 102&mdash;an increase of 2%, not an increase of 200% that one would expect if all spontaneous mutations were caused by background radiation.</p><p>RADIATION EXPOSURES IN THE UNITED STATES &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Millirems Natural Sources A.
