<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Suppose only one sex cell out of a million is damaged. If so, a damaged sex cell will, on the average, take part in one out of every million fertilizations. And when it is used, 36 it will not matter that there are 999,999 perfectly good sex cells that might have been used&mdash;it was the damaged cell that was used. That is why there is no threshold in the genetic effect of radiation and why there is no &ldquo;safe&rdquo; amount of radiations insofar as genetic effects are concerned. However small the quantity of radiation absorbed, mankind must be prepared to pay the price in a corresponding increase of the genetic load.</p><p>If the straight line obtained by plotting mutation rate against radiation dose is followed down to a radiation dose of zero, it is found that the line strikes the vertical axis slightly above the origin.</p></div> </div>
