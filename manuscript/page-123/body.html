<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This means that if the number of mutations is plotted against the amount of radiation absorbed, a straight line can be drawn.</p><p>It is generally believed that the straight line continues all the way down without deviation to very low radiation absorptions. This means there is no &ldquo;threshold&rdquo; for the mutational effect of radiation. No matter how small a dosage of radiation the gonads receive, this will be reflected in a proportionately increased likelihood of mutated sex cells with effects that will show up in succeeding generations.</p><p>In this respect, the genetic effect of radiation is quite different from the somatic effect. A small dose of radiation may affect growing tissues and prevent a small proportion of the cells of those tissues from dividing. The remaining, unaffected cells take up the slack, however, and if the proportion of affected cells is small enough, symptoms are not visible and never become visible.</p></div> </div>
