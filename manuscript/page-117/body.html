(Thus, cancers, which cannot safely be reached with the surgeon&rsquo;s knife, are sometimes exposed to high-energy radiation in the hope that the cancer cells will be effectively killed in that manner.)</p><p>33</p><p>The delicate structure of the genes and chromosomes is particularly vulnerable to the impact of high-energy radiation. Chromosomes can be broken by such radiation and this is the main cause of actual cell death. A cell that is not killed outright by radiation may nevertheless be so damaged as to be unable to undergo replication and mitosis.</p></div> </div>
